Hi,

Thanks for wanting to contribute to jamovi.

In order to contribute to the core jamovi code base (presently hosted at [www.github.com/jamovi/jamovi](https://www.github.com/jamovi/jamovi)), we require you to submit your contributions under a 'Contributor License Agreement', or CLA.

More information, including the motivations for a CLA, are detailed on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement).

There are two CLAs available, one for individuals, and one for 'entities' (i.e. companies). Select the CLA appropriate for you, fill it in, and email it to contact &lt;at&gt; jamovi.org.

We may ask you to refer to this submitted CLA when submitting pull requests.

 - [jamovi Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.jamovi.org/jamovi-Individual.pdf)
 - [jamovi Entity Contributor License Agreement](https://www.jamovi.org/jamovi-Entity.pdf)

You'll notice the CLA has room to specify 'Us'. Please contact us at contact &lt;at&gt; jamovi.org for the most up-to-date details.

Thanks.

  - the jamovi team
